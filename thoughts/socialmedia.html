    <p>BIGGEST REASON: future me
        I saw this ted talk that talked about how we pay for social media with our time and attention and that resonated with me.
        Social media capitalizes on so much from us. Money - tell me how many things you saw on social media that you purchased just to use once and then left it to collect dust
        Attention - that shit is cooked. Personally, i would always turn to tiktoks over movies or shows because i developed the attention for highly stimulating and short content
        Time - this is a me problem. If i had unlimited money and no responsibilities i could eat nap and tiktok all day. And iâ€™ve done that before. Those are days i lost to doing nothing valuable or fulfilling
