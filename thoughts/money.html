        <h2><u>Budget your money</u></h2>
        Budgeting is the key to managing your money. It helps you define and organize your spending habits and saving goals.
        There's a ton of different rules you can follow, online calculators/apps that make budgeting easy.
        <br>
        <b>Example: </b><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget#:~:text=We%20recommend%20the%2050%2F30,to%20savings%20and%20debt%20repayment.">50/30/20 rule</a>
        <br>
        Personally, I do everything on spreadsheets. I generally allocate more to saving and investing.

        <h3><u>-Reduce spending</u></h3>
        I try to make it a habit to spend money on necessities (groceries, gas, etc). Anything left over by the time I get my next paycheck
        I either use it for silly purchases or save/invest it.

        <h3><u>-Save</u></h3>
        I typically save a % of my paycheck, then divide that amount up for different categories (emergency funds, big purchases). Sometimes I'll invest a portion of it.
        
        <br>
        A general guideline for emergency fund is to save 3-6 months worth of expenses.
        <br><br>

        <h2><u>High Yield Savings Account </u>ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©</h2>

        <br>
        I think high-yield savings accounts (HYSA) are super underrated. They offer a higher interest rates compared to traditional banks, which generally offer 0.01%.
        <br>

        <b>Example:</b>
        If you have $500 in savings with a traditional bank you'd earn ~$0.05/year in interest.
        <br>
        In a HYSA with 4%, you'd earn ~$20/year.
        <br>
        This motivated me to save more money because after a certain amount, I'd earn enough interest per month to cover a meal or two.


        <h2><u>Invest</u></h2>
        It's better to just do some research on this one. I like telling people to invest just to plant the seed in their mind.
        <br>
        The earlier you invest the better. Buy low sell high blah blah

        <h2><u>Consider getting a credit card</u></h2>
        I started off with a student credit card. A lot of banks offer it.
        <br>
        Good credit -> better interest rates on loans -> saves you A LOT of money

        <h2><u>Youtubers i watch sometimes</u></h2>

        <br>
        <h2><u>Other things that help me</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy items second hand rather than new</li>
            <li>Deleted all food delivery apps (i'm not paying 2-3x the price of my food anymore)</li>
            <li>Sell items I don't use anymore</li>
        </ul>
